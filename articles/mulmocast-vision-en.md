## Setup

Here is an example for Claude desktop. Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`.  
You can use similar settings for other MCPs.

```json
// claude_desktop_config.json
"mulmocast-vision": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "mulmocast-vision@latest"
  ],
  "transport": {
    "stdio": true
  }
}
```

That's all for the setup.  
If the path to `npx` is not set, specify the full path.  
If `npx` is not installed, please install it in advance.

## How to Use

Just give an instruction like "Compare corporate analysis of AI companies such as OpenAi Anthropic Replicate. About 20 slides." and the slides will be generated.  
That's all you need to do.
